- studio template ui always has a dt selector
  this is more logical, as the historic-calculation always requires a date

  ther is one drawdown: if the current date is part of the algo-opts, 
  then it is easier to make a link to an algo at a specific date.


- studio template ui visualizations are now 100% arbitrary.
  the keywords used to give names to vizualisations do not have any requirements.
